NoSQL: Fitness Tracker


## Description

Using a pre-built front-end, I implemented a Mongo database and Mongoose schema to handle routes with Express.

The routes included:
* Adding an exervise to the most recent workout plan,
* Adding new exercises to a new workout plan,
* Viewing the combined weight of multiple exercies from the past 7 workouts on the dashboard,
* Viewing the total duration of each workout from the past 7 workouts on the dashboard.
